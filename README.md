# pybrain3_imitate_gpt

Welcome AI Engineers, Developers, and fellow inquisitors.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an attempt to imitate gpt-3 &amp; gpt-4 using pybrain, numpy, and the like. The closer one gets, the better. In this case, it is meant to imitate the token parsing & eventually the functionality of gpt-3 & gpt-4. The rest comes down to implementation, clever design, and maybe some elbow grease. Currently what is available in this repository is a way to imitate the gpt-3 & gpt-4 architecture. This is meant to be able to run on all devices that can run python.
