# pybrain3_imitate_gpt

Welcome AI Engineers, Developers, and fellow inquisitors.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an attempt to imitate gpt-3 &amp; gpt-4 using pybrain, numpy, and the like. The closer one gets, the better. In this case, it is meant to imitate the token parsing. The rest comes down to implementation.
